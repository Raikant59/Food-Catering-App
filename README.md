# Food Catering App

### Objective
Develop a Flutter application based on the provided Figma designs [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/VebfUm70gaotnKb6IWldLT/Assignment?t=lW3ISDILoGlVNsdJ-0), ensuring responsiveness and complete functionality.

---

## Features

1. **Figma Design Implementation**
   - Analyzed the Figma design to understand the structure and flow of the screens.
   - Implemented the following key screens:
     - Platters
     - Item Selection
     - Fill Details
     - Order Review
   - Ensured a close replication of the designs, maintaining alignment with UI specifications.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensured the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
   - Verified the responsiveness using multiple device emulators.

3. **Dynamic Pricing Behavior**
   - Implemented a dynamic pricing feature with the following logic:
     - Minimum value: â‚¹189
     - Maximum value: â‚¹299
     - Pricing adjusts dynamically based on the number of guests using a simple linear decrement function.

4. **Animations and Movements**
   - Smooth page transitions using Flutter's `SlideTransition`/`FadeTransition` animations.
   - Added animations for adding/removing items from selected platters.

5. **Validation and Final Touches**
   - Validated user inputs, including:
     - Ensuring the total number of guests does not exceed the maximum limit of **1500**.
   - Made all buttons and actions fully functional, ensuring a seamless user experience.
